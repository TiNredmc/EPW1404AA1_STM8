This is power design for the FlexWatch OLED project. Entire system is powered by 2.7-3.6 battery. 
NOTE : All part that said "in parallel" is the situation that I don't want to buy more passive component, so just use parallel resistor calculation to find out the lower resistance from connecting
multiple Higher resistance Resistor that I already have in parallel.

possible battery choices.
1. LIR1254 (more expensive than LIR2032 since it's not popular).
2. LIR2032 (probably my goto choice).


Vboost for OLED 
1. LTC3459. L = 33uH, R1 = 2M, R2 = x2 470k in parallel to get 11volt boost, Cvin = 1uF, Cvout = 2.2uF to 10uF.
2. LT3494. L = 15uH, R1 = 1.3M (x2 2M in parallel might work), Ccap = .22uF, Cvout = 2.2uF.

STM8L151F3 power.
1. Normal High speed core clock is running at 1MHz, RTC running with 38kHz LSI.
2. Put to sleep in Active halt mode, wake by portB EXTI (4 position mini joy stick + 1 middle button).
