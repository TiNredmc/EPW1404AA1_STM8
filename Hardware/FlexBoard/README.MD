# WARNING!

This is still in development. I DON'T recommend you to build using this board. Since I haven't done any electrical testing yet.  
Also schematic and board inspection haven't done enough. I might left some error in the design that can kill some precious components like OLED, Driver chip or STM8.

# Notice

I've removed all of the Rev 1 to Rev 3 board. Due to the connection design error. It turns out that connector only accept FPC with copper contact facing down. I need to redesign the board and came up with Rev4
